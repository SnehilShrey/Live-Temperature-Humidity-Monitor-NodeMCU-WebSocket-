# Live-Temperature-Humidity-Monitor-NodeMCU-WebSocket

An IoT project that displays real-time temperature and humidity data on a custom web page using NodeMCU (ESP8266). The sensor readings are collected from a DHT11/DHT22 sensor and transmitted to the browser through a WebSocket connection, ensuring live updates without page refresh. This project demonstrates real-time communication between embedded hardware and web applications.
